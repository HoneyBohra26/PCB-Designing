As part of my work in PCB design and microcontroller development, I designed a PCB for an ATmega328P microcontroller development board. This project involved utilizing Eagle software, a powerful tool for PCB design, to create detailed schematics and layout designs. Through this process, I mastered the steps necessary to generate Gerber files, which are essential for PCB production.

Additionally, I conducted successful breadboard implementations of the ATmega328P microcontroller to ensure the functionality of my designs. These implementations included tasks such as LED blinking and ultrasonic sensor testing, both of which were programmed using the Arduino IDE. This hands-on experience allowed me to verify the performance and reliability of the development board before moving forward with the final production.
